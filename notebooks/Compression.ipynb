      "&lt;!--Overview of discipline:--&gt;'''Psychology''' is the [[science]] of [[mind]] and [[behavior]]. Psychology includes the study of [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] phenomena, including [[feeling]]s and [[thought]]s. It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[Social science|social sciences]]. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to [[neuroscience]]. As a social science, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fernald&quot;&gt;Fernald LD (2008).

Indeed, [[cognitive-behavioral therapist]]s counsel their clients to become aware of maladaptive thought patterns, the nature of which the clients previously had not been conscious.&lt;/ref&gt; Research psychologists employ [[empirical method]]s to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables.

      "In China, psychological understanding grew from the philosophical works of [[Laozi]] and [[Confucius]], and later from the doctrines of [[Buddhism]]. This body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe in term of a division of physical reality and mental reality as well as the interaction between the physical and the mental. Chinese philosophy also emphasized purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as ''[[Huangdi Neijing|The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine]]'' identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on [[Yin and yang|yin–yang]] balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship that focused on the brain advanced during the [[Qing Dynasty]] with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611–1671), [[Liu Zhi (scholar)|Liu Zhi]] (1660–1730), and Wang Qingren (1768–1831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and [[insomnia]], and advanced a theory of [[Lateralization of brain function|hemispheric lateralization]] in brain function.&lt;ref name=HsuehGuo&gt;Yeh Hsueh and Benyu Guo, &quot;China&quot;, in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;\n",

      "Psychology was of interest to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment thinkers]] in Europe. In Germany, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum. He suggested that the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] identified psychology as its own science, writing ''Psychologia Empirica'' in 1732 and ''Psychologia Rationalis'' in 1734. [[Immanuel Kant]] advanced the idea of [[anthropology]] as a discipline, with psychology an important subdivision. Kant, however, explicitly rejected the idea of an [[experimental psychology]], writing that &quot;the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object.&quot; In 1783, [[Ferdinand Ueberwasser]] (1752-1812) designated himself ''Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic'' and gave lectures on scientific psychology, though these developments were soon overshadowed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, K.

This new Soviet psychology leaned heavily on Lenin's theory of reflection, which was unearthed in his two volumes posthumously published in 1924. Toward the late twenties, a group of Soviet research psychologists headed by Vygotskii, along with Luria and Leont'ev, laid the groundwork for a Marxist-Leninist approach to psychic development.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Psychology education was centralized under the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], supervised by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. In 1951, the Academy created a Psychology Research Office, which in 1956 became the Institute of Psychology. Because most leading psychologists were educated in the United States, the first concern of the Academy was the re-education of these psychologists in the Soviet doctrines. Child psychology and pedagogy for the purpose of a nationally cohesive education remained a central goal of the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Chin &amp; Chin, ''Psychological Research in Communist China'' (1969), pp. 18–24.&lt;/ref&gt;\n",

For psychology, Grimshaw (1986) discussed behaviorism's goals of modification, suggesting that behaviorist principles reinforced a hierarchical position between controller and controlled and that behaviorism was in principle an antidemocratic program.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;\n",

      "Some psychologists study motivation or the subject of why people or lower animals initiate a behavior at a particular time. It also involves the study of why humans and lower animals continue or terminate a behavior. Psychologists such as William James initially used the term ''motivation'' to refer to intention, in a sense similar to the concept of ''[[Will (philosophy)|will]]'' in European philosophy. With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation.&lt;ref name=ForgasEtAl&gt;Forgas, Williams, &amp; Laham, &quot;Social Motivation: Introduction and Overview&quot;, in Forgas, Williams, &amp; Laham, ''Social Motivation'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[drive theory]], the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as demands originating in the nervous system. Psychoanalysts believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the [[reality principle]], roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', Freud introduced the concept of the ''[[death drive]]'', a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and [[Repetition compulsion|psychic repetition of traumatic events]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, ''Human Motivation'' (2013), Chapter 2, &quot;The Psychoanalytic Theory of Motivation&quot; (pp. 9–84).&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking.&lt;ref name=ForgasEtAl /&gt;&lt;ref name=GodsilEtAl&gt;Bill P.

A theory based on environmental transmission would hold that an offspring, by virtue of his or her having a problematic rearing environment managed by a depressed mother, is at risk for developing depression. On the other hand, a hereditarian theory would hold that depression risk in an offspring is influenced to some extent by genes passed to the child from the mother.

      "The provision of psychological health services is generally called clinical psychology in the U.S. Sometimes, however, members of the school psychology and counseling psychology professions engage in practices that resemble that of clinical psychologists. Clinical psychologists typically include people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology. In Canada, some of the members of the abovementioned groups usually fall within the larger category of [[professional psychology]]. In Canada and the U.S., practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates; doctoral students in clinical psychology usually spend one year in a predoctoral internship and one year in postdoctoral internship. In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctoral degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school.&lt;ref name=HallHurley /&gt; Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology.&lt;ref name=StrickerWidiger /&gt; It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychological distress, dysfunction, and/or [[mental illness]]. Clinical psychologists also try to promote subjective well-being and personal growth. Central to the practice of clinical psychology are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain&quot;&gt;Brain, Christine.

      "Credit for the first psychology clinic in the United States typically goes to [[Lightner Witmer]], who established his practice in Philadelphia in 1896. Another modern psychotherapist was [[Morton Prince]], an early advocate for the establishment of psychology as a clinical and academic discipline.&lt;ref name=StrickerWidiger&gt;George Stricker &amp; Thomas A. Widiger, &quot;Volume Preface&quot;, in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first part of the twentieth century, most mental health care in the United States was performed by psychiatrists, who are medical doctors. Psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing, which promised to improve the diagnosis of mental problems. For their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using [[psychoanalysis]] and other forms of [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]] to understand and treat the mentally ill.&lt;ref name=Tomes2008 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy McWilliams]] and Joel Weinberger, &quot;Psychodynamic Psychotherapy&quot;, in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.&lt;/ref&gt;\n",

      "Psychotherapy as conducted by psychiatrists blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology, and this trend continued with the rise of [[Community mental health service|community mental health facilities]]. Some in the clinical psychology community adopted [[behavioral therapy]], a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model that used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients. A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness. In the 1970s, [[cognitive-behavior therapy]] emerged with the work of [[Albert Ellis]] and [[Aaron Beck]]. Although there are similarities between behavior therapy and cognitive-behavior therapy, cognitive-behavior therapy required the application of cognitive constructs. Since the 1970s, the popularity of cognitive-behavior therapy among clinical psychologists increased. A key practice in behavioral ''and'' cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, based on the premise that their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.&lt;ref&gt;W.

      "Some clinical psychologists focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury. This subspecialty is known as [[clinical neuropsychology]].

      "The work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential–humanistic, and systems or family therapy. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong [[therapeutic relationship|therapeutic alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leichsenring, Falk |author2=Leibing, Eric |year=2003 |title=The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1223–1233 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223 |pmid=12832233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reisner, Andrew |year=2005 |title=The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=377–400|doi=10.1007/BF03395517 |s2cid=142840311 |url=https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1192&amp;context=tpr }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic therapeutic orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jensen, J.P. |author2=Bergin, A.E. |author3=Greaves, D.W. |year=1990 |title=The meaning of eclecticism: New survey and analysis of components |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=124–130 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.21.2.124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S.; Woolfe, R.

      "A [[true experiment]] with [[randomized controlled trial|random]] assignment of research participants (sometimes called subjects) to rival conditions allows researchers to make strong inferences about causal relationships. When there are large numbers of research participants, the random assignment (also called random allocation) of those participants to rival conditions ensures that the individuals in those conditions will, on average, be similar on most characteristics, including characteristics that went unmeasured. In an experiment, the researcher alters one or more variables of influence, called [[independent variable]]s, and measures resulting changes in the factors of interest, called [[dependent variable]]s. Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.\n",

The goal of many cross-sectional studies is the assess the extent factors are correlated with each other. By contrast, in [[longitudinal studies]] psychologists collect data on the same sample at two or more points in time. Sometimes the purpose of longitudinal research is to study trends across time such as the stability of traits or age-related changes in behavior. Because some studies involve endpoints that psychologists cannot ethically study from an experimental standpoint, such as identifying the causes of depression, they conduct longitudinal studies a large group of depression-free people, periodically assessing what is happening in the individuals' lives. In this way psychologists have an opportunity to test causal hypotheses regarding conditions that commonly arise in people's lives that put them at risk for depression.

This ''volta'' can often take the form of a &quot;but&quot; statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines.

The line length is scanned by an according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a [[caesura]] before the final three syllables.

The antistrophes of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure. Odes have a formal poetic diction and generally deal with a serious subject. The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues. Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals), with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Gayley |first1=Charles Mills |title=English Poetry |last2=Young, Clement C |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4179-0086-2 |edition=Reprint |page=lxxxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, differing forms for odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode.

      "'''Probability''' is the branch of [[mathematics]] concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an [[Event (probability theory)|event]] is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true.  The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty.{{NoteTag|Strictly speaking, a probability of 0 indicates that an event [[almost surely|''almost'' never]] takes place, whereas a probability of 1 indicates than an event [[almost surely|''almost'' certainly]] takes place. This is an important distinction when the [[sample space]] is infinite. For example, for the [[continuous uniform distribution]] on the [[real number|real]] interval [5, 10], there are an infinite number of possible outcomes, and the probability of any given outcome being observed — for instance, exactly 7 — is 0. This means that when we make an observation, it will ''almost surely not'' be exactly 7. However, it does '''not''' mean that exactly 7 is ''impossible''. Ultimately some specific outcome (with probability 0) will be observed, and one possibility for that specific outcome is exactly 7.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuart and Ord 2009&quot;&gt;&quot;Kendall's Advanced Theory of Statistics, Volume 1: Distribution Theory&quot;, Alan Stuart and Keith Ord, 6th Ed, (2009), {{ISBN|978-0-534-24312-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feller&quot;&gt;William Feller, ''An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications'', (Vol 1),  3rd Ed, (1968), Wiley, {{ISBN|0-471-25708-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes (&quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot;) are both equally probable; the probability of &quot;heads&quot; equals the probability of &quot;tails&quot;; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot; is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).\n",

      "When dealing with [[experiment]]s that are [[random]] and [[well-defined]] in a purely theoretical setting (like tossing a coin), probabilities can be numerically described by the number of desired outcomes, divided by the total number of all outcomes. For example, tossing a coin twice will yield &quot;head-head&quot;, &quot;head-tail&quot;, &quot;tail-head&quot;, and &quot;tail-tail&quot; outcomes. The probability of getting an outcome of &quot;head-head&quot; is 1 out of 4 outcomes, or, in numerical terms, 1/4, 0.25 or 25%.

This action angered many Poles who considered it a [[Yalta betrayal|betrayal]] by the Allies. In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place. However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organized by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs. The Soviet Union instituted a new [[communist state|communist]] government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]].

In 1956, after the death of [[Bolesław Bierut]], the régime of [[Władysław Gomułka]] became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms. [[Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic]] failed. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under [[Edward Gierek]], but most of the time persecution of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–1989)|anti-communist opposition]] groups persisted.

Prior to the twentieth century, storytelling was the most recognized form of entertainment, although today, some forms still remain. One form, ''Naghali,'' was traditionally performed in coffeehouses where the storytellers, or ''Naghals (Naqqāls),'' only recited sections of a story at a time, thus retaining regular cliental. These stories were based on events of historical or religious importance and many referenced poetry from the [[Shahnameh]]. Oftentimes these stories were altered to bond with the atmosphere or mood of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=&quot;Memory of a Phoenix Feather&quot; - ProQuest|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/209398361|access-date=2021-09-20|website=www.proquest.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n",

      "Folk theatre and dramatics can be traced to the religious ritualism of the [[Vedic period|Vedic peoples]] in the [[2nd millennium BC]]. This folk theatre of the misty past was mixed with dance, food, ritualism, plus a depiction of events from daily life. The last element made it the origin of the classical theatre of later times. Many historians, notably D. D. Kosambi, Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, Adya Rangacharaya, etc. have referred to the prevalence of ritualism amongst [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes in which some members of the tribe acted as if they were wild animals and some others were the hunters. Those who acted as mammals like goats, buffaloes, reindeer, monkeys, etc. were chased by those playing the role of hunters.\n",

      "[[Bharata Muni]] (fl. 5th–2nd century BC) was an ancient Indian writer best known for writing the ''[[Natya Shastra of Bharata]]'', a theoretical treatise on Indian performing arts, including theatre, dance, acting, and music, which has been compared to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. Bharata is often known as the father of Indian theatrical arts. His ''Natya Shastra'' seems to be the first attempt to develop the technique or rather art, of drama in a systematic manner. The Natya Shastra tells us not only what is to be portrayed in a drama, but how the portrayal is to be done. Drama, as Bharata Muni says, is the imitation of men and their doings (''loka-vritti''). As men and their doings have to be respected on the stage, so drama in Sanskrit is also known by the term ''roopaka'', which means portrayal.\n",

      "During the Han Dynasty, [[shadow puppetry]] first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Cantonese southern and Pekingese northern. The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the puppets, as opposed to the type of play performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather that created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather usually taken from the belly of a donkey. They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods that controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the 11th century before becoming a tool of the government.\n",

A director of one of these companies, Kan'ami (1333–1384), had a son, [[Zeami Motokiyo]] (1363–1443), who was considered one of the finest child actors in Japan.

      "Japan, after a long period of civil wars and political disarray, was unified and at peace primarily due to {{transl|ja|shōgun}} [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] (1600–1668). However, alarmed at the increasing numbers of Christians within the country due to the proselytizing efforts of Christian missionaries, he cut off contact from Japan to Europe and China and outlawed Christianity. When peace did come, a flourish of cultural influence and growing merchant class demanded its own entertainment. The first form of theatre to flourish was Ningyō jōruri (commonly referred to as [[Bunraku]]). The founder of and main contributor to Ningyō jōruri, [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] (1653–1725), turned his form of theatre into a true art form. Ningyō jōruri is a highly stylized form of theatre using puppets, today about {{frac|1|3rd}} the size of a human. The men who control the puppets train their entire lives to become master puppeteers, when they can then operate the puppet's head and right arm and choose to show their faces during the performance. The other puppeteers, controlling the less important limbs of the puppet, cover themselves and their faces in a black suit, to imply their invisibility. The dialogue is handled by a single person, who uses varied tones of voice and speaking manners to simulate different characters. Chikamatsu wrote thousands of plays during his lifetime, most of which are still used today.\n",

      "[[Kabuki]] began shortly after Bunraku, legend has it by an actress named Okuni, who lived around the end of the 16th century. Most of kabuki's material came from Noh and Bunraku, and its erratic dance-type movements are also an effect of Bunraku. However, kabuki is less formal and more distant than Noh, yet very popular among the Japanese public. Actors are trained in many varied things including dancing, singing, pantomime, and even acrobatics. Kabuki was first performed by young girls, then by young boys, and by the end of the 16th century, kabuki companies consisted of all men. The men who portrayed women on stage were specifically trained to elicit the essence of a woman in their subtle movements and gestures.\n",

      "The country's dual name results from its complex administrative history before independence. In the nineteenth century, [[German Empire|Germany]] ruled the northern half of the country for some decades, beginning in 1884, as a colony named [[German New Guinea]]. In 1914 after the outbreak of [[World War I]], Australian forces [[Australian occupation of German New Guinea|captured German New Guinea]] and occupied it throughout the war. After the war, in which Germany and the [[Central Powers]] were defeated, the [[League of Nations]] authorised Australia to administer this area as a [[League of Nations mandate]] territory that became the [[Territory of New Guinea]].\n",

      "Also 1884, the southern part of the country became a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[protectorate]].  In 1888 it was annexed, together with some adjacent islands, by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as British New Guinea. In 1902, Papua was effectively transferred to the authority of the new British [[dominion]] of [[Australia]]. With the passage of the Papua Act 1905, the area was officially renamed the Territory of Papua, and Australian administration became formal in 1906. In contrast to establishing an Australian mandate in former German New Guinea, the League of Nations determined that Papua was an external territory of the Australian Commonwealth; as a matter of law it remained a British possession. The difference in legal status meant that until 1949, Papua and New Guinea had entirely separate administrations, both controlled by Australia.

      "In the early years of independence, the instability of the party system led to frequent [[motion of no confidence|votes of no confidence]] in parliament, with resulting changes of the government, but with referral to the electorate, through national elections only occurring every five years. In recent years, successive governments have passed legislation preventing such votes sooner than 18 months after a national election and within 12 months of the next election. In 2012, the first two (of three) readings were passed to prevent votes of no confidence occurring within the first 30 months. This restriction on votes of no confidence has arguably resulted in greater stability, although perhaps at a cost of reducing the accountability of the executive branch of government.\n",

The stand-off between parliament and the supreme court continued until the July 2012 national elections, with legislation passed effectively removing the chief justice and subjecting the supreme court members to greater control by the legislature, as well as a series of other laws passed, for example limiting the age for a prime minister. The confrontation reached a peak, with the deputy prime minister entering the supreme court during a hearing, escorted by police, ostensibly to arrest the chief justice. There was strong pressure among some MPs to defer the national elections for a further six months to one year, although their powers to do that were highly questionable. The parliament-elect prime minister and other cooler-headed MPs carried the votes for the writs for the new election to be issued, slightly late, but for the election itself to occur on time, thereby avoiding a continuation of the constitutional crisis.\n",

      "Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, including mineral and renewable resources, such as forests, marine (including a large portion of the world's major tuna stocks), and in some parts agriculture. The rugged terrain—including high mountain ranges and valleys, swamps and islands—and high cost of developing infrastructure, combined with other factors (including law and order problems in some centres and the system of customary land title) makes it difficult for outside developers. Local developers are hindered by years of deficient investment in education, health, and access to finance. Agriculture, for subsistence and cash crops, provides a livelihood for 85% of the population and continues to provide some 30% of GDP. Mineral deposits, including gold, oil, and copper, account for 72% of export earnings. [[Elaeis guineensis|Oil palm]] production has grown steadily over recent years (largely from estates and with extensive outgrower output), with [[palm oil]] now the main agricultural export. Coffee remains the major export crop (produced largely in the Highlands provinces); followed by [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coconut oil]]/[[copra]] from the coastal areas, each largely produced by smallholders; tea, produced on estates; and rubber.

Measures have been taken to mitigate these effects, including through the establishment of a [[sovereign wealth fund]], partly to stabilise revenue and expenditure flows, but much will depend upon the readiness to make real reforms to effective use of revenue, tackling rampant corruption and empowering households and businesses to access markets, services and develop a more buoyant economy, with lower costs, especially for small to medium-size enterprises.

      "Only some 3% of the land of Papua New Guinea is in private hands; this is privately held under 99-year state lease, or it is held by the State. There is virtually no freehold title; the few existing freeholds are automatically converted to state lease when they are transferred between vendor and purchaser. Unalienated land is owned under customary title by traditional landowners. The precise nature of the [[seisin]] varies from one culture to another. Many writers portray land as in the communal ownership of traditional clans; however, closer studies usually show that the smallest portions of land whose ownership cannot be further divided are held by the individual heads of extended families and their descendants or their descendants alone if they have recently died.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n",

      "This is a matter of vital importance because a problem of economic development is identifying the membership of customary landowning groups and the owners. Disputes between mining and forestry companies and landowner groups often devolve on the issue of whether the companies entered into contractual relations for the use of land with the true owners. Customary property—usually land—cannot be devised by will. It can only be inherited according to the custom of the deceased's people.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The Lands Act was amended in 2010 along with the Land Group Incorporation Act, intended to improve the management of state land, mechanisms for dispute resolution over land, and to enable customary landowners to be better able to access finance and possible partnerships over portions of their land, if they seek to develop it for urban or rural economic activities.
